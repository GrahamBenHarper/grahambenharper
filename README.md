### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm not really sure what to put here, but since you're looking at my profile, you're probably looking for more information about my software. 
Currently I develop high performant software for heterogeneous computing clusters to solve mathematical and physical applications. 
More specifically, I've worked on the deal.II and Trilinos libraries quite a bit. 
However, I'm an extremely passionate person, so the software you may find here certainly isn't limited to that.

I'm a millenial whose dad got me started with computers and software development early. 
How early, you ask? 
Well, early enough that I grew up playing Chip's Challenge, Jezzball, Pipe Dream, and Rodent's Revenge. 
*That's right, we're talking Windows 95/98.* 

This means, roughly two decades ago, I learned basic HTML and C programming, 
and those skills helped start me on my path with software development. 
In high school class I learned to make video games in Flash (rest in peace), 
and when I wasn't in school I helped run a website with my best friend and a lot of other good friends. 
The website focused on video game modding for fifth-generation consoles, 
and it was written with mostly HTML, Javascript, CSS, and PHP. 
Fun fact: we even got one of the top three prizes in the Drunken Coders Third Annual Christmas Game Coding Competition (2007). 
In my undergraduate and graduate studies I explored a plethora of programming/scripting languages: 
Bash, C/C++ and CMake, Objective-C (yes, I made an iOS app), Java, Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, Powershell, Python, and more. 
I learned the parallel computing paradigms Cuda, MPI, OpenMP in graduate school, 
which are what I focus on for most of my development today.

Of course, there are plenty of non-software topics that I'm very passionate about as well. 
I'm always happy to chat; I especially enjoy discussing 3D printing, 3D animation/meshing/modeling/texturing, 
video game modding, electronics hardware repair, mathematical art, mathematics education, and music.

I try to avoid making my contact details **too public**, 
but I'm sure you'll find a way to get in touch with me if you want to talk more. ðŸ˜‰

Cheers,

Graham
